I think the older I get, the more I start to understand how valuable time is.

I once heard the quote, “When you’re young, you exchange money for time. When you’re old, you exchange time for money.”

I think I understand what that means now. I spent my Sunday night upgrading the framework of my blogging platform. It took about 3/4 hours and my blog looks exactly the same.

Why did I do that? What was the benefit of it? I have an update blogging framework, but does that really matter? Maybe in the long run it will.

I could have spent that time writing up an article or enjoying my Sunday night.

Maybe I’m being overly critical of myself, maybe I’m not. There are many that would be on both sides of the camp.

The point is, I think I should have strongly weighed my options before going down this path. Maybe it’ll be worth it. Maybe I’m over-optimizing for the wrong thing.

Maybe I’m just too cheap to pay for Ghost and stuck doing things manually! Who knows :)
