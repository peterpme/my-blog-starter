The older I get the more I start to understand how valuable time really is.

Years ago I heard a quote that went something like, "When you’re young, you exchange money for time. When you’re old, you exchange time for money.”

Maybe I'm just getting impatient as I age, but I think I'm starting to understand what that means now. I used to think that I had all the time in the world.

Now that family life, weddings, friendships and eventually kids are starting to show up in my daily life, I'm starting to see that I've got much less time than I used to!

I spent my Sunday night upgrading the framework for this blog. It took me about 3 hours to do and at the end of it, my blog looks exactly the same. You might think to yourself, "4 hours isn't that much!" and you're right, it's not. But when you've got other things going on and features to build, you start to pay attention to that time spent.

I asked myself, "was it worth it?" Should I have just paid $9/mo for Ghost and moved on? Maybe. Probably. Why didn't I do it then? Is it because I like to own my own data? Is it because I'm worried Ghost will go out of business and I'm stuck exporting files from within some walled garden? That is something that came up too.

I could have spent that Sunday night writing up a new article or spending some more quality time with Lauren.

Maybe I'm being overly critical of myself, maybe I worry too much about optimization at the edge. Maybe I'm just looking for a reason to write something.

The point is, I'm realizing my time is becoming precious. I should get used to that sooner rather than later.
