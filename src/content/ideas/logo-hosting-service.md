Logo / wordmark hosting service

i've been exploring this idea for a project that hosts your company's brand assets for developers and i'm looking to see if this is interesting to anyone else.

you would upload your svg, png logo/brand/wordmark and any variations of that logo. you'd set a CNAME redirect everything from your favicon to app icon to this one spot. this project would auto generate the correct sizes and formats wherever a developer would need it.

down the road, this project could generate a branding kit page where anyone could download a zip file with up-to-date logos (like you see on public/private websites)

does this sound interesting to anybody? at least enough to consider looking into the repo? or has this problem been solved in another way?

for example, i've found myself always looking around for the right logo for the right format.
