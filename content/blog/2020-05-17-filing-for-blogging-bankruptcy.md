You want to know the worst part about blogging? It's the part where you don't actually get to writing anything.

You spend days, weeks, maybe even months tirelessly trying to get your Gatsby theme to look like Kent C. Dodd's and by the time you get there, you're totally over it!

Then you wait another 3 months before that _need_ to do great things comes over you. You've completely forgotten about how complicated Gatsby setup can be so you start over. Rinse & Repeat.

Don't get me wrong, Gatsby is great (at least marketing has told me this). I'm tired of setting things up from scratch.

I generated this new starter blog with minimal effort. I added disqus. I'm adding a home page. I'm calling it a day.

Welcome to my new blog, powered by Gatsby.
