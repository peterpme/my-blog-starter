One of the most overlooked parts of building a business is time. From the time it takes to close your first customer to the time it takes to build something sustainable.

Chances are, you're going to underestimate your timelines.

If you think you're going to build a successful business overnight, your first year or even your third, especially if you've never done it before, you're setting yourself up for failure.

I'm sure you've seen the Youtube videos or Twitter posts about some 16yo marketing guru making $1m after a couple of months.

That is not real.

Even if there are folks getting to the point of making $1m, it's taken them _years_ of trial and error to get there and plenty of failure.

The beautiful part is, like we constantly see in this community, is that folks figure it out eventually. It can take as few as 4 years or as much as 10 for a business to take off.

Some folks get a bit of headwind and manage to pull it off earlier. Others win the lottery.

When you're in your 2nd year struggling to make any money and you see a friend in the community crushing it, it can suck the wind out of you. The temptation to give up gets real.

The most important thing you can do in that situation is to keep your eyes on the prize.

Your time will come, it just won't come when you expect it to.
