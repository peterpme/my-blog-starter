Setting up IKEA's Fyrtur blinds with Home Assistant is easy. No gateway required.

My blinds were previously controlled with the remote control and repeater, aka a "working state". I was able to switch over to Home Assistant just fine, without having to reset anything.

## Steps

- Make sure to charge your blind battery to 100%. This helps with pairing.
- Press and hold the top and bottom buttons on the blinds for a couple seconds until they start breathing/flashing.
- Go over to your Zigbee setup in Home Assistant and press "Add Device".

That's it! In about a couple of seconds you should have your blinds. You no longer need to use the repeater. The remote will not work either.

You might be able to program the remote to talk to HomeAssistant but I haven't done that.
