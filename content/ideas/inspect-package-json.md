Blogs, news websites, a place with articles, etc all have categories based on some arbitrary approach.

The approach the category is created could have changed over the years so now you're left with all sort of categories that may not make sense.

I think AI can help change that by inputting the whole article and suggesting a different category format or even new categories based on all the other posts.
