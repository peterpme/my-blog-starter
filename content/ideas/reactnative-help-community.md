reactnative.help

The problem: React Native guides and resources are scattered. Stack Overflow, blogs and Twitter are great in the moment, but otherwise ephemeral.

The new features and tutorials come and go. Many of the foundational stuff hasn't changed, but as React Native & Expo versions go up, things do fall out of date.

There's no better way to build apps right now, but I find myself on the hunt for certain things that I know we could do a better job at organizing.

The initial website should be simple. Links to everything you need, versioned by a specific react native/expo sdk. The site can be broken down into different
topic areas like layout, native modules, etc.

Links could have a "helpful or not" feature. It's not about upvoting the way you might use Hacker News or Reddit, but more about "is this still relevant?".

The website can expand into job boards, a consulting funnel, etc. We can eventually work with Sebastian on a special "This Week in React Native".

The website doesn't need to serve millions of people. It just needs to serve the every day person looking to find answers to less-than-obvious answers
