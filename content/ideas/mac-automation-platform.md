MacOS Automation Product

Goal:

- Empower users to automate parts of their macOS automations
- Get users to pay for this tool

A UI for workflows on your Mac:

- Connecting to wifi
- Connecting or disconnecting a usb device
- Connecting multiple monitors

Building on those workflows:

- Connecting a USB cable in when youâ€™re at home on your wifi
- Opening up work apps depending on the specific time of day
- Window management?
- Opening up chrome with separate profiles?
- Opening up terminal and running commands?

Having a command bar that lets you create these automations quickly
Using templates and allowing folks to build on them
